This code examines a webscrapped database of sephora products, and finds some basic exploratory data analysis. This code (sephorawordstuff) then parses the descriptions of the products using NLTK to tag verbs, adjectives, and nouns and then compares the relative frequency of those words between two different categories as chosen by the user. This can be used to compare relative frequency of words in high vs low rated products, or cheap vs expensive products to examine how description key words change depending on group of product.
